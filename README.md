# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I made a rock paper scissors game
I gave the computer a function to randomly select it's choce
Since there is no UI at this time, the game uses the alert option to play the game
The game function runs 5 rounds and the winner is chosen
I implemented a simple loop to run the game 5 times and incorporated if statements to determine the winner.
